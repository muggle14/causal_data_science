# causal data science
This is the companion GitHub repository for my talk on causal data science at ODSC'19.
It has the data and codes needed to replicate the case study that the audience has been
walked through as well as useful reference papers for self study. Broadly, the contents include:
1. The dataset used in the talk - data_obv_exp.csv
2. The R code used for running matching procedures in the talk - ODSC_tak_model_final.R
3. A bunch of papers for reading up on causal inference techniques (not just limited to matching !).
